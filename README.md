# qr-code-for-linkdin-profile
through usage of code of this project we can generate a qr code for webpages we want to and we can also implement this code for the usage of payment qr code by applying more security algorithms 
this is a small project made by using libraries of python named as  pyqrcode and png 
through this libraries we can make qr code for any url and create an png format image through it  
in the website variable we have to put the url for which we are making this qr code 
then after making it we need it to generate it in png format and after that we can print "qr code generated successfully" to know that we have made the qr code
